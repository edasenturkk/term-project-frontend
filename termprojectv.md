Term Project Presentation Guidelines
For your presentations, you do not need to prepare any slides. It is expected that you show
your application running on the cloud and execute the operations given. Your work will be
graded according to the behavior of these operations. Please come with your own laptops
with an HDMI port. (In case you do not have one, you can use the PCs of your friends or just
send me a message via teams so that I can prepare my PC including your work).
You should also show your source codes. Note that for the groups, I am going to ask each
individual member about different parts of the code and explain how the tasks are done. (In
case you do not have enough knowledge of your group work, you might not have any
grades from the project. Therefore, it is strongly suggested to prepare accordingly.)
The operations you are going to execute are as follows:
1. Show Home Page and explain how you execute the required actions on this page
(without actually executing those actions).
2. Show that your database already has at least 10 different users with required rates
and comments described on the project file. Show User Page and explain how you
execute the required actions on this page (without actually executing those actions).
3. Show that your database already has at least 10 different games with required
optional fields, rates and comments described on the project file. Show Game Page
and explain how you execute the required actions on this page (without actually
executing those actions).
4. Add two different users.
5. Add two different games with photos (one of them should have the optional fields
added).
6. For a single newly added user, try to rate and comment on any game and see if the
action works as intended.
7. For each newly added user, play these newly added 2 games with different play
times.
8. For each newly added user, rate these games with different ratings.
9. Comment with one of the newly added users and after that execute the disable rating
& comment action to see if this action works as intended.
10. Execute enable rating & comment action. Then rate and comment on the new games
with the second newly added user.
11. Play one of the newly added games with a new user again to check if the rating is
updated properly.
12. Change the rating and comment of the same user on the same game to check if this
works as intended.
13. Remove one of the newly added users and check if the ratings, play times and
comments are also updated.
14. Remove one of the newly added games and check most played game, average of
ratings and comments on the users are also updated.
The presentations will be on two days: 5th and 12th May, 09:40. Be in the class on time. If
you are absent at the time of the presentation I will continue with the next group and
your grades will be reduced. (Do not forget that the submission deadline is the same for
everyone: 4th May.)The ordering of the presentations and the days are given as follows:
